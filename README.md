# Frontiers-in-Applied-Drug-Design---Application-of-ORCA-for-Interaction-Energy-Calculation
In this repository, I report my project of applying the tool ORCA, using the the coupled cluster method with singles, doubles, and perturbatively included triples excitations with the inear-scaling domain-based local pair natural orbital, DLPNO-CCSD(T).
